# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-ray
I have made this project for pneumonia detection using CNN model.

This repository contains an end-to-end solution for Pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that can be challenging to diagnose accurately. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by automating the detection process through deep learning.
Features
CNN Model: The core of the project is a robust CNN model trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images. The model is designed to classify X-ray images into normal or pneumonia-infected categories with high accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing scripts ensure that input images are appropriately cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training.
Web Application (Optional): For user-friendly interaction, an optional web application is provided, allowing users to upload chest X-ray images and receive instant predictions from the trained model.
